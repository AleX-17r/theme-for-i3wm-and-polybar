# theme-for-i3wm-and-polybar
This is a simple script that allows you to easily change and save your current i3 and polybar theme and settings.
# Usage:
To set a theme, run the script with ''./theme set (theme-name)''. This will copy the configuration files inside the ~/themes/(theme-name) directory to the i3 and polybar configuration.

To save a theme, run the script with ''./theme save (theme-name)''. This will copy the i3 and polybar config into the ~/themes/(theme-name) directory.

Feel free to change anything on the script :)
